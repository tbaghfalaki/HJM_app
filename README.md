# Description 
The paper by Ganjali et al. (2024) presents two applications: pregnancy data and AIDS data. Both datasets are publicly available. Below are the implementation details and steps for computing the risk predictions.

# Required Packages
To implement these applications, you need the ZI and DPCri packages, which are available at the following URLs:

* ZI package:  https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/ZI.

* DPCri package: https://github.com/tbaghfalaki/DPCri.

# Implementation Steps

1. Pregnancy Data
The code for implementing the pregnancy data application involves fitting a Zero-Inflated Joint Model and computing the risk prediction. This analysis of pregnency data is presented [here](/Exam1.md)

3. AIDS Data
The code for the AIDS data application similarly involves fitting a Zero-Inflated Joint Model and computing the risk prediction. This analysis of AIDS data is presented [here](/Exam2.md)
